## Design

- I decided to make the website have an old school arcade game feel which is reflected in my background image and choice of font and fucntions, as well as colour scheme.

## Colors Chosen

- The colors which formed the basis of my website were; black, blue, green and red, the green and red specifically were used to display your own choices and outcomes against the red of the computer (opponent).

## Typography

- Sans Seriff, was the main font of choice as I feel it gave the game the 90's arcade game feel.

- As I didn't want to overcrowd the simplistic game with lots of different images I chose to just use 1 image, which is the background image with gives the 90's old school gaming feeling.
